- Once you get a little more comfortable in Azure, you can check out GPS's [AZ-104 Project Challenges](https://github.com/madebygps/projects/blob/main/az-104/readme.md). While going through these challenges, document your progress. That can be used during interviews to show off your skills. 

- After spending some time studying and training, take the AZ-104 [Microsoft Practice Questions](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/exams/az-104/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=21https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/#certification-exams) to get a little hint of what the questions may look like. 

- If you do not have an Azure Account, click the [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) link to start your free Azure Account that can be used for training and projects. You get $200 in credit that has to be used in the first 30 days as well as some other [Free Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/#all-free-services) for 12 months. 

- If you create a new Azure Account (or have an existing account), make sure to set up [Budget Alerts](https://github.com/CityHallin/public/blob/main/resources/azure/cost/setup_budget_alert.md) so you get notified about your budgeted costs.
