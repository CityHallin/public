# Discord Server Channels

- [Information Channels](#information)
- [Normal Channels](#normal)
- [Moderation Channels](#moderation)

### Information Channels <a name="information"></a>
Information channels are usually read-only channels that give members information about the Discord server. Only Administrators, some Moderators, and certain bots have access to post to these channels. Everyone else normally only has the following permissions:

- View Channels
- Read Message History

If emoji reactions are placed on these posts by Administrators, Moderators, or bots then anyone can click on the reaction to increase the count. Regular members just cannot add new reactions. Examples of these channels:

- Server Rules = Displays server rules.
- Announcements = Display any server-wide member announcements. 
- Server Updates (non-sensitive) = Shows non-sensitive server updates (example: like new users that joined). 
- Reaction Roles = Posts with emoji reactions used by bots to grant members other roles for categorization or selective channel visibility.

### Normal Channels <a name="normal"></a>
Normal channels are for all members to review and post messages in a regular member capacity. 

### Moderation Channels <a name="moderation"></a>
Moderation channels should be private and only allow visibility to Administrations, Moderators, and some bots. No regular members should even see these channels. Examples of these channels:

- General Moderation = Standard channel moderators can have moderator-related conversations members cannot see.
- Server Updates (sensitive) = Shows sensitive server updates that regular members should not see (example: users banned, alerts on server events, bot logs, community logs, etc.)
