- [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)

### User Settings <a name="usersettings"></a>
- My Account
    - The email account used to set up your Discord account, make sure it follows the recommendations below for secure passwords, 2FA, recovery options, etc. 
    - Verify your email address for this Discord account. 
    - Set a Discord user name that does not contain any words or phrases that may be restricted by Discord server block policies (example: sexual or profane words and terms). 
    - Use a long, secure password. Do not use words or phrases that are well known to you (example: a pet's name, your town name, etc.). It is best to use a password manager to generate a secure password for you or use a long passphrase with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
    - Change your Discord password on a regular basis. Discord does not enforce this, so this will have to be a personal task. For accounts that are used for server Administration, password rotation is key to providing good security on your servers. 
    - Setup two factor authentication (2FA) on your account.
        - Save the 2FA backup codes to a secure storage area like a password manager.  If you lose your 2FA device, this will allow you to recover your account
    - Set your account up with a verified phone number. Discord does not seem to allow for virtual numbers so an actual carrier phone number will have to be used. 
    - In the future, Security Keys or Pass Keys will be allowed on user accounts which will be worth investigating. 
- Privacy and Security: Preferences Tab
    - Explicit Image Filter = Filter all direct messages
    - DM Spam Filter = Filter all direct messages
    - Allow direct messages from server members = Enable or Disable as you please, but if Enabled, it is recommended to Enable this with the setting below forcing new messages to be approved by your account first. Discord accounts used as server Administrators should have this disabled.

- Friend Requests

    - Friends of Friends = Enable or Disable as you please. This depends on how open to new requests you'd like to be and how you intent to use Discord.

### User Account Tips <a name="useraccounttips"></a>
- Consider anything posted on Discord as not secure or limited with privacy regarding the Discord organization's visibility, even DMs, as end-to-end encryption is not yet a feature. The links to Discord's policies are at the top of this document for your review. 
- Be aware of friend requests or messages from users you do not know.
- Be mindful of spam or phishing attempts:
    - Free gifts
    - Server join requests you did not ask for
    - Asking for your account information
    - Social engineering attempts for other information
- Do not share passwords, access tokens, API keys, secrets, etc. 
- Be mindful of suspicious hyperlinks before clicking on them.
- Do not share personal information with anyone you do not know.
